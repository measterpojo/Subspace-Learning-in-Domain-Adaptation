Introduction

Subspace learning involves finding a shared feature space (or subspace) where the source and target domains can be aligned. By projecting data from both domains into this common subspace, the model can reduce the domain shift (differences in data distributions) and improve its ability to generalize to the target domain.

Key Concepts:

Domain Shift:

The source and target domains often have different distributions, making it hard for a model trained on the source domain to perform well on the target domain.

Subspace learning mitigates this by aligning the distributions in a shared subspace.

Feature Transformation:

Data from both domains is transformed into a lower-dimensional subspace where the structural relationships between the domains are preserved.

Optimization:

The subspace is learned by minimizing the difference between the source and target distributions while preserving the discriminative structure of the source domain.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

Reduces dimensionality and finds a subspace that captures the most variance in the data.
